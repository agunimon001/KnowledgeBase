# Installation

I installed Eclipse EE 2018-12 (4.10.0) from Eclipse.org website.
On the day of accessing the website, there seemed to be some server error, so I bypassed it by adding "/downloads/packages/" to the URL.

> If you wish to do a one-time installation, you can look at Eclipse with Spring Tools version in spring.io.

After installing the IDE, I proceeded to install Spring Tools 4 addon in the Eclipse Marketplace.

I enjoy using this add-on for its "Relaunch" function which is a convenience to use.
Also useful is its ability to auto-suggest when you're editing your POM for Spring projects.

You should also install JDK. As of writing, current latest version is at JDK 11.0.1.
However, my current installed version is JDK 8.
