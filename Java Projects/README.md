# Installation

I installed Eclipse EE 2018-12 (4.10.0) from Eclipse.org website.
On the day of accessing the website, there seemed to be some server error, so I bypassed it by adding "/downloads/packages/" to the URL.

> If you wish to do a one-time installation, you can look at Eclipse with Spring Tools version in spring.io.

I installed the IDE in advanced mode and changing the VM to my JDK.
This solved a "tools.jar" problem which I encountered in the prior round of building the first project.
After installing the IDE, I proceeded to install Spring Tools 4 addon in the Eclipse Marketplace.

> Whenever Eclipse is running (look at progress window), I strongly suggest that you wait till it finishes before doing anything else in the IDE.

I enjoy using this add-on for its "Relaunch" function which is a convenience to use.
Also useful is its ability to auto-suggest when you're editing your POM for Spring projects.

You should also install JDK. As of writing, current latest version is at JDK 11.0.1.
However, my current installed version is JDK 8.
